## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I learned the essential fundamentals of HTML structure, including the organization of the head and body sections, and the use of semantic tags like header, main, and footer. In terms of CSS, I explored various styling techniques, such as utilizing Flexbox. Although this project was relatively simple, I believe mastering these core skills is crucial for every developer. In school, we often jump straight into advanced topics like MVC and backend frameworks, but I found that a solid grasp of HTML and CSS basics lays the foundation for a successful Web Application.
